# Snake!

It's Snake! In Godot!!  
Choose from 19 color palettes and 5 game speeds.

- Made to emulate the style of the Nintendo Game Boy
- The palette swapping and the ripple on the text at the start are done with custom shaders
- The snake on the title screen was animated and drawn entirely programmatically
- This game took me much longer than it had any business taking me haha
